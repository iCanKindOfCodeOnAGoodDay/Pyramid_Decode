I don't mind spending a few hours to write some code. Every time I work on a diffult coding problem I become a better Developer. 
You'll see that I solved Data Annotation's pyramid decryption problem with a full program written in python. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. Data Annotation made me a better python programmer by solving their pyramid encryption problem.
