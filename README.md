I also got some good practice writing Python code. 
Data Annotation also got me thinking about optimizing code for time complexity and space efficiency.
So I am glad that I took the Data Annotation assessment. 

I don't mind spending a few hours to write some code. Every time I work on a diffult coding problem I become a better Developer. 
You'll see that I solved Data Annotation's pyramid decryption problem with a full program written in python. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. Data Annotation made me a better python programmer by solving their pyramid encryption problem.
But, they did kind of get my hopes up, thinking that I would actually get a job offer making $40+ an hour based on the assessment only.
What can you do though? Sometimes you just gotta write some code for the sake of becoming a better developer. 

Don't get your hopes up about Data Annotation. 
You can ace the Data Annotation programmer assessment, and never hear back from Data Annotation. 
Heres's my solution to the pyramid encryption problem.
