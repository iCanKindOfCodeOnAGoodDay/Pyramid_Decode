This is my solution to the Data Annotation assessment. I spent quite a bit of time on this, and unfortunately for me, my 
algorithm for the pyramid decode problem was not enough to get a job offer from Data Annotation. 

That all being said, my solution to the Data Annotation pyramid decode problem does work. It does solve the problem. 

My answers to Data Annotation's assessment questions are correct. 

This all makes me wonder if the Data Annotation assessment is actually 
the only criteria that they are using to select programmers to work on the AI code training roles, or if it's all for show
that the Data Annotation assessment is actually the only criteria that Data Annotation is using to select programmers for employment.ion 

If you run my code for the decryption algorthim, you'll see that my solution solves the problem
that Data Annotation wanted me to solve. 

I don't mind spending a few hours to right some code. Every time I work on a diffult coding problem I become a better Developer. 
You'll see that I solved Data Annotation's pyramid decryption problem with a full program written in python. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. Data Annotation made me a better python programmer by solving their pyramid encryption problem.
But, they did kind of get my hopes up, thinking that I would actually get a job offer making $40+ an hour based on the assessment only.
What can you do though? Sometimes you just gotta write some code for the sake of becoming a better developer.
