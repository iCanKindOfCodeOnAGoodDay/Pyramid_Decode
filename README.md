Data Annotation Assessment Solutions

I do wonder though if the Data Annotation assessment is actually the only criteria that they are using to select 
programmers to work on the AI code training roles, or if it's all for show. Because Data Annotation 
does make it sound like all you have to do is pass their assessment and boom, 
Data Annotation makes you an employment offer and you get unlimited work for $40+ an hour. 

But it didn't work this way for me. I crushed their assessment. I know I did. And still, no offer.

My code is well documented, up to par with industry standard like my professor taught me in University. 
If you run my code for the decryption algorthim, you'll see that my solution solves the problem
that Data Annotation wanted me to solve. My answers to the other questions are on the assessment are not 
full programs like the Pyramid Decode algorithm, but they are well thought out and correct. 

Yet, no offer. No big job making $40+ an hour from Data Assessment. No unlimited work. 
So is Data Annotation really legit? I have no idea. I think they are. 

Are they truthful in their messaging?
"Pass the assessment get virtually unlimited work for $40".
I passed, I know I did! But, still no work. 
All I got from Data Annotation was radio silence and and a bunch of ads. 

But I also got some good practice writing Python code. 
Data Annotation also got me thinking about optimizing code for time complexity and space efficiency.
So I am glad that I took the Data Annotation assessment. 

I don't mind spending a few hours to write some code. Every time I work on a diffult coding problem I become a better Developer. 
You'll see that I solved Data Annotation's pyramid decryption problem with a full program written in python. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. Data Annotation made me a better python programmer by solving their pyramid encryption problem.
But, they did kind of get my hopes up, thinking that I would actually get a job offer making $40+ an hour based on the assessment only.
What can you do though? Sometimes you just gotta write some code for the sake of becoming a better developer. 

Don't get your hopes up about Data Annotation. 
You can ace the Data Annotation programmer assessment, and never hear back from Data Annotation. 
Heres's my solution to the pyramid encryption problem.
